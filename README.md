a passion project i made in unity quite some times ago. earlier this year i had switch to godot, and had been developing stuff there for more than half a year at this point.

its a breakout-like game mishmashed with shoot em up elements.

an important project that i enjoyed making and gave me tons of experience. id *love* to remake and complete it in godot at some point.

but why this?

i couldnt really bring myself to use unity again without feeling.. off.
 
basically, i cant take it seriously again.

the long load times, the accounts, the comparatively excessive stuff you have to sift through, the huge project file size, whatever.

i assume this is the same feeling people with relationships have when having to suddenly work with their ex boyfriend/girlfriend

also i absolutely despise themes and prompts, as i feel that they hinder my creativity than anything. 
so its not like i could think of anything good anyways.

but i guess the "rocks" kinda fit with the theme?
